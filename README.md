# Predicting-loan-payback-using-single-Decision-Tree-vs-Random-Forest-on-Lending-Club-data-set

This workbook attempts to create a model based on lending data to predict whether the loan will be repaid in full or not.
I used a decision tree initially, followed by a random forest.
Neither gave particularly brilliant performance.
I need to revisit this in the future, perhaps with better domain knowledge (it's a little unclear what specific features actually represent), larger dataset, or maybe using some sort of feature engineering.
